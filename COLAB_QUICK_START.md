## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**❌ "No data files found"**
- ✅ Make sure you uploaded CSV files in Step 6
- ✅ Check file names contain "PET" and "Resource" and "Allocation"

**❌ "ngrok tunnel failed"**
- ✅ Try running the last cell again
- ✅ Or skip ngrok and use local access only

**❌ "Processing errors"**
- ✅ Check your CSV format - the notebook auto-detects most formats
- ✅ Ensure percentage columns contain numeric values

### Manual File Upload Alternative
If the automatic upload doesn't work:

1. Click the **📁 folder icon** on the left sidebar in Colab
2. Navigate to the `data` folder
3. Drag and drop your CSV files directly
4. Re-run the cells from Step 7 onwards

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### For Best Performance
- **Upload your largest/most recent CSV file first**
- **Use WiFi** for faster uploads
- **Keep the browser tab active** while running

### For Team Sharing
- **Copy the ngrok URL** from the final output
- **Share via Slack/Email** - anyone can access instantly
- **The URL stays active** as long as the notebook is running

### For Regular Use
- **Bookmark the Colab notebook** for easy access
- **Save a copy to your Google Drive** (File → Save a copy in Drive)
- **Run weekly** with new data uploads

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Your Data is Safe
- ✅ **Files stay in your Colab session** - not permanently stored on Google servers
- ✅ **Sessions are isolated** - other users can't access your data
- ✅ **ngrok URLs are temporary** - expire when you close the notebook
- ✅ **No data leaves the session** except via the dashboard you control

### Best Practices
- **Don't share sensitive data** via public URLs
- **Use the secure version** (`PET_Dashboard_Secure_Colab.ipynb`) for confidential data
- **Close the notebook** when done to terminate public access

## ⚡ Need It Even Faster?

### Option 1: Direct URL Share
```
1. Upload PET_Dashboard_Colab.ipynb to Google Colab
2. Share the Colab notebook URL directly with your team
3. They can run it themselves with their own data
```

### Option 2: Copy & Paste
```
1. Copy the contents of any cell from the .ipynb file
2. Paste into a new Colab notebook
3. Run cell by cell for step-by-step control
```
